<H1>Problem Statement</H1>
<p>Managing personal finances can be challenging for individuals who struggle to keep track of their daily expenses. Many people fail to track their spending habits due to the lack of an easy-to-use system, leading to overspending, financial stress, and an inability to save effectively. Existing solutions are often either too complex or don't cater to the specific needs of users seeking a simple and straightforward approach to expense tracking.</p>
<H1>Project Description</H1>
<p>This project is a web-based expense tracker designed to help users easily record and monitor their daily expenses. The application allows users to input expenses in categories such as food and beverages, rent, transport, and others. Users can input the amount spent and the date of the transaction, and the tracker calculates the total expenses accordingly.
<br>The website dynamically displays images related to the expense categories (e.g., food and beverages, rent, transport) as users log their expenses. The project is deployed using Azure Static Web Apps for hosting, ensuring a scalable and efficient solution. Additionally, images for the expense categories are stored and retrieved using Azure Storage Account containers, enhancing the visual appeal of the interface.</p>
